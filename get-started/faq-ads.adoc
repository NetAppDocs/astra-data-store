Find answers to the frequently asked questions about installing, configuring, upgrading, and troubleshooting Astra Data Store.


== General questions

*Can I use Astra Data Store for production?*
No. While Astra Data Store is designed and developed to deliver enterprise grade resiliency, this release of Astra Data Store is not targeted for production workloads.

*Can I use Astra Data Store for virtual machine workloads?*
//Astra Data Store release is limited only to applications running on Kubernetes, whether on bare metal or virtual machines. Future releases will support applications on both Kubernetes and directly on ESXi virtual machines.
Yes. Astra Data Store supports both bare metal and VM-based deployments, and supports both Kubernetes and VMware vVol workloads.

 See link:../get-started/requirements.html[Astra Data Store requirements].

*Does Astra Data Store have any dependencies on other NetApp products for its functioning?*

Yes. Astra Data Store requires NetApp CSI driver Astra Trident version 21.10.1 and later to be deployed on workload Kubernetes clusters. Learn about link:../use-vmware/ads-vmware-requirements.html[Astra Data Store with VMware requirements].

Applications using an Astra Data Store cluster as a storage backend can use https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-control-center/index.html[Astra Control Center^] version 21.12 to leverage application-aware data management capabilities, including data protection, disaster recovery, and migration of Kubernetes workloads.

*How can I manage Astra Data Store cluster?*
You can manage Astra Data Store assets by using kubectl commands and by using the Kubernetes API extension.

The `kubectl astrads` command includes an `-h` switch that provides usage and flag documentation for your convenience.

*How can I monitor Astra Data Store cluster metrics?*
You can monitor Astra Data Store metrics using Cloud Insights. See link:../use/monitor-with-cloud-insights.html[Monitor metrics with Cloud Insights].

You can also monitor logs. See link:../use/configure-endpoints.html[Configure and monitor event logs].

*Can I use Astra Data Store along with ONTAP or other storage providers in my Kubernetes clusters?*
Yes. Astra Data Store can be used along with other storage providers in your application clusters.

*Will Astra Trident be uninstalled if I remove a Kubernetes cluster from Astra Data Store?*
Astra Trident will not be uninstalled from the cluster if you uninstall Astra Data Store. If you require Astra Trident to be uninstalled, you will have to do it separately.

== Licensing

*Does Astra Data Store require a license?*
Yes, Astra Data Store requires a NetApp license file (NLF).
//The Astra Data Store preview release also requires a NetApp license file (NLF).

See link:../get-started/requirements.html[Astra Data Store requirements].

*How long is the Astra Data Store license valid?*
The Astra Data Store license has a default term of 90 days from the download date.


== Installation and use of Astra Data Store on a Kubernetes cluster

*Can I install Astra Data Store on a Kubernetes cluster running on bare metal or virtual machines?*
Yes. Astra Data Store can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster running on bare metal or on ESXi VMs. See link:../get-started/requirements.html[Astra Data Store requirements].

*What are the supported versions of Kubernetes for Astra Data Store?*

Astra Data Store works with Kubernetes distributions that are compatible with v1.20 and later. However, it is not currently validated with all Kubernetes distributions. Learn about link:../get-started/requirements.html[Astra Data Store requirements].

*My Kubernetes cluster is larger than 5 worker nodes. Can I install Astra Data Store on it?*
Yes. An Astra Data Store cluster can be deployed on 4 worker nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. After deployment, you can grow the cluster to 5 worker nodes.

*Does Astra Data Store support an offline installation from a private registry?*
Yes. Astra Data Store can be installed offline from a local registry. See link:../get-started/install-ads.html[Install Astra Data Store]. However, Astra Data Store requires connectivity (direct or via a proxy) to the NetApp AutoSupport backend (support.netapp.com) for continued operations.

*Do I need internet connectivity to use Astra Data Store?*
Astra Data Store requires connectivity to the NetApp AutoSupport backend to periodically send the mandatory telemetry AutoSupport bundles. This connectivity can be direct or via a proxy. If this connectivity is missing or AutoSupport is disabled, the cluster will lock down and new volume creation will be disabled until the periodic bundle uploads are resumed.

*What are the roles and privileges used by Astra Data Store?*
You need to be a kube admin to deploy the Astra Data Store operator.

Astra Data Store has a privileged daemonset called `astrads-ds-nodeinfo-astradsversion` for discovering node resources used in selecting nodes.

In addition, the operator will use privileged Kubernetes jobs to install the storage clusterâ€™s containers on the selected worker nodes to build the Astra Data Store storage cluster.

*What manifest files do I need to update for Astra Data Store installation?*
From the Astra Data Store bundle you download from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-data-store/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^], you will get the following manifests:

*	astradscluster.yaml
*	astradsoperator.yaml
*	astradsversion.yaml
*	monitoring_operator.yaml

You will need to update the `astradscluster.yaml` manifest with your deployment-specific configuration. See link:../get-started/install-ads.html[Install Astra Data Store].

== Troubleshooting and support

With Astra Data Store, you can access community support using the NetApp Containers Slack channel. This channel is monitored by NetApp Support and our Technical Marketing Engineers.

https://netapp.io/slack[NetApp Container Slack channel^]

This release requires that your system is connected to the cloud and integrated into the NetApp Active IQ and AutoSupport tools.

See link:../support/get-help-ads.html[Astra Data Store support operations].

*How do I raise a support case OR ask clarification on a quick question?*
To raise a support case or get clarification on a quick question, report your issue or question on the https://netapp.io/slack[NetApp Container Slack channel^]. NetApp Support will follow up with you to assist on a best-effort basis.

*How do I raise a request for a new feature?*
If you have questions on supported configurations or capabilities, reach out to astra.feedback@netapp.com.

*How do I generate a support log bundle?*
See link:../support/get-help-ads.html#generate-support-bundle-to-provide-to-netapp-support[Generate support bundle] for instructions on setting up and downloading support log bundles for Astra Data Store.

*Astra Data Store cannot find my Kubernetes node. How do I fix this?*
See link:../get-started/install-ads.html[Install Astra Data Store].

*Can IPv6 addresses be used for management, data, and cluster networks?*
No, Astra Data Store only supports IPv4 address. IPv6 support will be added in a future release of Astra Data Store.

*What NFS version is used while provisioning a volume on Astra Data Store?*
By default, Astra Data Store supports NFS v4.1 for all volumes provisioned for Kubernetes applications.

*Why can't I get larger persistent volumes even though I have configured Astra Data Store with large capacity drives?*
Astra Data Store limits the maximum capacity provisioned for all volumes on a node to 2 TiB and up to 32 TiB across all nodes in an Astra Data Store cluster.

See link:../get-started/requirements.html[Astra Data Store requirements] and link:capabilities.html[Astra Data Store limits].

== Upgrading Astra Data Store
*Can I upgrade from Astra Data Store preview release?*
Yes. You can upgrade from the Astra Data Store 2021.12.1 patch release.
