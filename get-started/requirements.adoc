Get started by verifying that your environment meets Astra Data Store requirements.

//POLARIS-654 and POLARIS-450
== Persistent volume sharing requirements
Each Astra Data Store cluster supports using persistent volumes to cover the storage needs of any apps installed on that cluster. Persistent volumes in Astra Data Store have the following requirements and limitations:

.Requirements
* NFS 4.1 client/server in Kubernetes clusters
* Kubernetes apps will access files through persistent volumes shared over NFS 4.1, which requires the the AUTH_SYS authentication method.

.Capabilities
* Parallel NFS (pNFS) is not supported.
* Only IP-based export policies are supported.

//POLARIS-458
== Node minimum resource requirements
A minimum size cluster of Astra Data Store is 3 nodes. The minimum resource requirements for each node in an Astra Data Store cluster are as follows:

* Minimum number of drives: 2
* Minimum number of CPU cores: 4
* Minimum RAM: 4GB
* Minimum number of NW BW: 10Gb
* Minimum storage capacity: 1TB

//POLARIS-460
//dissimilar node types and HW and capabilities are supported for scale
== Astra Data Store cluster expansion requirements
Astra Data Store supports nodes of different types and capabilities in a cluster. If you are expanding a cluster, Astra Data Store supports adding nodes with any performance capabilities, as long as they are not lower than the least performant node in the cluster. All nodes, including new nodes during an expansion, need to at least meet the minimum requirements in <<Node physical resource requirements>>.

//POLARIS-461
== Supported media types in Astra Data Store
Astra Data Store clusters support SAS and NVMe TLC SSD storage with the following capabilities:

* Maximum capacity per drive: 15.36TB
* Maximum number of drives per node: 24
* Maximum number of nodes per cluster: 40

//POLARIS-656 - more questions here for HA requirements (Naveen M is SME)
== Astra Data Store high availability requirements
Astra Data Store requires Element 12.3 or later for high availability to function correctly. High availability makes use of the Element software Protection Domains feature.

//POLARIS-2175
== Astra Data Store hardware and software requirements
Astra Data Store requires the following hardware and software configuration on each node:

.Software
* Operating systems: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 and 8.2
* Kubernetes distribution: OpenShift 4.6, Anthos 1.7
* Kubernetes version: 1.19

.Hardware
* HPE DL360
* HPE DL380
* Dell R640
* Dell R740

//POLARIS-2317 and 2316
== Feature and expansion capabilities of Astra Data Store Starter Edition
Astra Data Store Starter Edition has certain feature and expansion limitations.

.Minimum resource requirements
Min. Memory requirement per node: 32GiB

.Feature capabilities
* NFS vVols are not supported
* Cloud connection is required

.Expansion limitations
