Astra Data Store uses storage efficiency technologies based on ONTAP technologies including:

* Thin provisioning
* Zero-block elimination
* Compression
* Deduplication
* Data tiering using Fabric Pool

See https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/index.jsp[storage efficiency details].

Astra Data Store offers a storage efficiency guarantee similar to that offered by ONTAP appliances as limited by the hardware resources provided to its clusters and only in all-flash configurations.
