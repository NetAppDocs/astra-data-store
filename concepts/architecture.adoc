== Astra Data Store environment

The Astra Data Store preview supports the following environment:

[%header,cols="2, 5a"]
|===
|Features
|Customer provided Kubernetes cluster

|Description
|Provides storage for Kubernetes native apps whose lifecycle is managed by Astra Control Center.

|Deployment
|Deployed in various ways:

* On bare metal or virtual volumes.

* As a standalone, dedicated Kubernetes cluster serving persistent volumes to Kubernetes apps running in a separate cluster, providing storage to Astra Control Center (standalone cluster)

* With the Kubernetes applications running in the same cluster on the same node pool (converged)

* With the Kubernetes applications running in the same cluster on different node pools (disaggregated)


|Drives
|Manages storage drives directly on hosts.

|Kubernetes cluster provided by
|Customer provides the Kubernetes cluster.

== Platform and other tools used by Astra Data Store
Astra Data Store works with the following:

* *Kubernetes clusters*: Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Astra provides management services for applications hosted in a Kubernetes cluster.
+
Astra Data Store is a Kubernetes app itself deployed into a Kubernetes cluster that provides data services for Kubernetes apps.

* *Astra Trident*: As a fully supported open source storage provisioner and orchestrator maintained by NetApp, Trident enables you to create storage volumes for containerized applications managed by Docker and Kubernetes.
+
You use Trident to create volumes on Astra Data Store.

* *Cloud Insights*:  A NetApp cloud infrastructure monitoring tool, Cloud Insights enables you to monitor performance and utilization for your Kubernetes clusters managed by Astra Control. Cloud Insights correlates storage usage to workloads. When you enable the Cloud Insights connection in Astra Control, telemetry information shows in Astra Control UI pages.
+
Cloud Insights displays information about resources in Astra Data Store.


== Astra Data Store interfaces

You can complete tasks using different interfaces:

* *Web user interface (UI)*: Astra Control Service and Astra Control Center use the same web-based UI where you can manage, migrate and protect apps. This UI also displays information about Astra Data Store volumes.

* *API*: Astra Control Service and Astra Control Center use the same Astra Control API. Using the API, you can perform the same tasks that you would using the UI. You can also retrieve information about Astra Data Store with the Astra Control API.

* *kubectl commands*: To work with Astra Data Store, you can also use kubectl commands directly.
