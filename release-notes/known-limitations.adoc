//CB review
In the preview release, the link:../get-started/install-ads.html#install-the-astra-data-store-cluster[periodic settings that are used for sending mandatory telemetry AutoSupport bundles] should not be changed.Â If you disable the sending of periodic AutoSupport bundles, the cluster will be locked down and new volumes cannot be created until periodic settings are enabled again.
