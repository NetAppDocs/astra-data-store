Known issues identify problems that might prevent you from using this preview release of the product successfully.

== Default Calico WireGuard interface name is not recognized by Astra Data Store preview
//burt 1442348
This error causes the pods to crash. As a workaround, change the wireguardInterfaceName setting in Calicoâ€™s Felix configuration to specify an interface name without a dot. For example:

----
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardInterfaceName":"calico_wg"}}'
----

In addition to creating interfaces on each node with the new name, this change might also leave behind the original wireguard.cali interfaces. Delete these interfaces to prevent this issue from recurring.

== Network interface names with VXLAN configuration and Calico CNI are not recognized by Astra Data Store preview
This error causes the pods to crash. As a workaround, disable VXLAN configuration.

== MongoDB deployment with default liveness probe value fails with pods in crash loop
As a workaround, set the liveness probe initialDelaySeconds to 600 seconds in the MongoDB deployment spec.

== Installation of monitoring operator fails on upstream Kubernetes 1.22
//Praveen from final review
The Astra Data Store monitoring operator uses deprecated API version that is not compatible with upstream k8s 1.22 version.

== Astra Data Store preview monitoring with Cloud Insights is not available for Kubernetes 1.22 deployments
The monitoring operator uses an API version that is not compatible with Kubernetes 1.22.

== lockd reconnect shows "double SYN" or immediate 3-way teardown after successful 3-way handshake
