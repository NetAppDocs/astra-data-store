To monitor Event Management System (EMS) logs, you can do the following high level tasks:

* <<Configure monitoring in the Astra Data Store cluster custom resource (CR)>>
* <<Set up Cloud Insights>>
* <<Stream event logs to Elastic>>.

== Configure monitoring in the Astra Data Store cluster custom resource (CR)

If the monitoring option has not been configured the Astra Data Store cluster CR, you can set it up using `astrads` extensions.

== Set up Cloud Insights

See link:../use/monitor-with-cloud-insights.html[how to set up NetApp Cloud Insights] for use with Astra Data Store.


== Stream event logs to Elastic
To stream EMS events and other pod logs to streams logs to a third-party endpoint such as Elastic, use the `astrads` extensions.
