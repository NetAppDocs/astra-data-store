== Manage certificates
You can manage certificates for Astra Data Store.  This enables you to revoke compromised or expired  certificates, or manually rotate certificates to fit the needs of your organization.
////

== Revoke a compromised or expired certificate
If an Astra Data Store cluster controller, node, or CA certificate is compromised or expires, you can revoke it so that a new certificate is generated automatically. You can revoke any Kubernetes certificate at any time.

.Steps
. Log in to one of the nodes in the Astra Data Store cluster.
. List the existing certificates on the system. For example:
+
----
kubectl get secret
----
+
The output should be similar to the following:
+
----
NAME                                   TYPE                             DATA   AGE
astrads-autosupport-certs              Opaque                           5      16m
astrads-cert-cluster-0008e44           kubernetes.io/tls                4      15m
astrads-cert-cluster-controller        kubernetes.io/tls                4      15m
astrads-cert-node-prod-org             kubernetes.io/tls                4      15m
----
. In the output, note the name of the certificate you need to revoke.
. Use the `kubectl` utility to revoke the certificate, replacing `CERTIFICATE_NAME` with the name of the certificate. For example:
+
----
kubectl delete secret CERTIFICATE_NAME
----

.Result
The existing certificate is revoked, and a new certificate is automatically generated in its place.

=== Revoke a controller certificate
If the cluster controller certificate is compromised, you can revoke it so that a new certificate is generated automatically for the controller.

.Steps
. Log in to the controller node of the Astra Data Store cluster.
. List the existing certificates on the system. For example:
+
----
kubectl get secret
----
+
The output should be similar to the following:
+
----
NAME                                   TYPE                             DATA   AGE
astrads-autosupport-certs              Opaque                           5      16m
astrads-cert-cluster-0008e44           kubernetes.io/tls                4      15m
astrads-cert-cluster-controller        kubernetes.io/tls                4      15m
astrads-cert-node-prod-org             kubernetes.io/tls                4      15m
----
. Note the controller certificate in the output.
. Revoke the controller certificate. For example:
+
----
kubectl delete secret astrads-cert-cluster-controller
----

.Result
The existing controller certificate is revoked, and a new controller certificate is generated automatically.

=== Revoke a node certificate
If a node certificate is compromised, you can revoke it so that a new certificate is generated automatically for the node.

.Steps
. Log in to a node of the Astra Data Store cluster.
. List the existing certificates on the system. For example:
+
----
kubectl get secret
----
+
The output should be similar to the following:
+
----
NAME                                   TYPE                             DATA   AGE
astrads-autosupport-certs              Opaque                           5      16m
astrads-cert-cluster-0008e44           kubernetes.io/tls                4      15m
astrads-cert-cluster-controller        kubernetes.io/tls                4      15m
astrads-cert-node-prod-org             kubernetes.io/tls                4      15m
----
. Note the node certificate in the output.
. Revoke the node certificate. For example:
+
----
kubectl delete secret astrads-cert-node-prod-org
----

.Result
The existing node certificate is revoked, and a new node certificate is generated automatically.
