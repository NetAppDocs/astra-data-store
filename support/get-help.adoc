NetApp provides support for Astra Data Store in a variety of ways. Extensive free self-support options are available 24x7, such as knowledgebase (KB) articles and a Slack channel. Your Astra Data Store account includes remote technical support via web ticketing.

IMPORTANT: If you have an evaluation license for Astra Data Store, you can get technical support. However, case creation via NetApp Support Site (NSS) is not available. You can get in touch with Support via the feedback option or use the Slack channel for self service.

You must first link:../get-started/setup_overview.html[activate support for your NetApp serial number] in order to use these non self-service support options. A NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account is required for chat and web ticketing along with case management.

== Self-support options

== Automatic support monitoring (concept info)
AutoSupport monitors the Astra Data Store system run-time and system information and sends messages to NetApp Support. AutoSupport (ASUP) bundles are available from the NetApp Support Site (NSS) or for manual uploads. AutoSupport is enabled by default during link:../get-started/install-ads.html#install-the-astra-data-store-cluster[Astra Data Store cluster installation]. AutoSupport bundles are collected after an AutoSupport CR is applied to the cluster.

AutoSupport bundles are triggered in the following ways:

* Periodically: ASUP Bundles are created at intervals defined in a CR.
* User Triggered: You can manually create your own ASUPs to look at the log.
* Coredumps: If there are core dumps on a node, an ASUP is generated, and the core is sent to NetApp for further investigation.
* Callhome event based: An ASUP is generated from a particular callhome event from the operating system.
* Kubernetes event based: An ASUP is generated from a particular kubernetes event in the control plane.

These trigger scenarios generate one of these Autosupport types:

* ControlPlane AutoSupport: A collection of Astra Data Store control plane logs and CRs.
* Storage AutoSupport: A collection of storage reports and performance data.
* Core Dump AutoSupport: A collection of system core dumps.

=== Configure control plane AutoSupport


=== Configure storage AutoSupport


=== Download an ASUP Bundle

=== Upload an ASUP Bundle

=== ASUP Mapping of Events to Collections (concept info)




=== Enable daily scheduled support bundle upload to NetApp Support

During Astra Data Store installation, if you specified `enrolled: true` for `autoSupport` in the Astra Data Store Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file (`astra_data_store_min.yaml`), daily support bundles are automatically uploaded to the NetApp Support Site.

=== Generate support bundle to provide to NetApp Support

Astra Data Store enables the admin user to generate bundles, which include information useful to NetApp Support, including logs, events for all the components of the Astra deployment, metrics, and topology information about the clusters and apps under management. If you are connected to the Internet, you can upload support bundles to NetApp Support Site (NSS) directly from the Astra Data Store UI.

NOTE: The time taken by Astra Data Store to generate the bundle depends on the size of your Astra Data Store installation as well as the parameters of the requested support bundle. The time duration that you specified when requesting a support bundle dictates the time it takes for the bundle to be generated (for example, a shorter time period results in faster bundle generation).

Before you begin, determine whether a proxy connection will be required to upload bundles to NSS. If a proxy connection is needed, verify that Astra Data Store has been configured to use a proxy server.

. Select *Accounts* > *Connections*.
. Check the proxy settings in *Connection settings*.

.Steps
. Create a case on the NSS portal using the license serial number listed on the *Support* page of the Astra Data Store UI.
. Perform the following steps for generating the support bundle by using the Astra Data Store UI:
.. On the *Support* page, in the Support bundle tile, select *Generate*.
.. In the *Generate a Support Bundle* window, select the timeframe.
+
You can choose between quick or custom timeframes.
+
NOTE: You can choose a custom date range as well as specify a custom time period during the date range.
.. After you make the selections, select *Confirm*.
.. Check the *Upload the bundle to the NetApp Support Site when generated*.
+
image:upload-bundle.png[Shows the upload Support bundle to NSS checkbox.]
.. Select *Generate Bundle*.
+
When the support bundle is ready, a notification appears on the *Accounts* > *Notification* page in the Alerts area, on the *Activity* page, and also in the notifications list (accessible by selecting the icon in the top-right side of the UI).
+
If the generation failed, an icon appears on the Generate Bundle page. Select the icon to see the message.

TIP: The notifications icon at the top-right side of the UI provides information about events related to the support bundle, such as when the bundle is successfully created, when the bundle creation fails, when the bundle could not be uploaded, when the bundle could not be downloaded, and so on.

=== If you have an air-gapped installation

If you have an air-gapped installation, perform the following steps after the Support bundle is generated.
When the bundle is available for download, it appears next to *Generated* in the *Support Bundles* section of the *Support* page as shown:

image:support-bundle.png[Shows the Support bundle generated and ready for download.]

. Select the *Download* icon to download the bundle locally.
. Manually upload the bundle to NSS.
+
You can use one of the following methods to do this:

* Use https://upload.netapp.com/sg[NetApp Authenticated File Upload (login required)^].
* Attach the bundle to the case directly on NSS.
* Use NetApp AIQ.
